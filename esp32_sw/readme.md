# ESP32-S3 Software

Not yet started, but this is what I want to build:
- Simple web interface to upload config files for FPAA
- FPAA configuration interface (bit-bang SPI)
- RGB LED web interface (maybe tie in with FPAA configuration)
- ZRNA API (eventually)
- Web based scope to .wav converter (http://bummsn.de/osc_txt/)
- File manager for SD card (for wav files, etc.)
- Playback of .wav files via I2S DAC
- Custom SW for I2C/GPIO header
- Make button do something
- USB Host?
- Serial terminal?
